# Transparent Housing Contract
## College students only receive information that a landlord provides to them, thus making them more prone to being swindled.

We created a Solidity smart contract so that interactions between landlords and tenants can be viewed on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes work orders, house renovations, current tenant information, and the ability to pay and collect rent.

We used Remix an online solidity complier to not only test on a mock blockchain with fake ether. http://remix.ethereum.org
